# Ray Questions:
## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Where is the best place for you to land a successful joke: Around Family, Around Friends, when you were writing at the Dailyer, or when you are up on the stage delivering to strangers.
2. Okay so you were just on a podcast a few weeks okay and I want to just hear about that. What kinda background things happened that maybe the average listener might not expect.
3. Now I know you are currently on the eat like shit and feel bad diet, but was that always true? Were you big into the food scene in Lincoln? If yes:
  3b. What was your favorite place to go to? Any places that stand out as a kind of hidden gem?
4. PICTURE OF NEBRASKA Mascot: So you seem to have a thing with Herbie Husker? Can you explain that? Where did the fascination with mascots start? Who is better, Lil' Red?
5. Alright so you loved Blood Meridian, ya shilled it to all of us, went as far as to give Billy and I seperate copies of the books, and your jokes about scalping are pretty infamous, but what part of McCarthy's writing resonated with you? Was it just the topic or is there more there?
6. So I have been pretty vocal about my feelings in our group chat concerning social media and how better I feel about myself now that I've kinda abandoned it entirely. You, however, seem to consistently be able to find good jokes or bits on twitter and you seem to have a semi-active Facebook, looking at our deep dive. What advice would you give to me if I was looking to curate my social media so that I can enjoy it without all the political commentary, dog shit opinions, or just other white noise that fills up the internet?
7. You invited us all out to your show recently and it was awesome, from start to finish funny, but there have been plenty of nights we haven't all been there to watch you. Are there jokes you've tried to tell up there that the audience just wasn't receiving?
8. As a known jokester you have told plenty of jokes on and off the stage, but are there any jokes that haven't landed that you desperately still think to this day are funny?
9. What is the worst you have seen someone flop up on stage? Do you remember the joke or bit they were trying to do?
10.
